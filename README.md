# InstantRespawn
Players respawn instantly or with delay in defined worlds
## About
This plugin was made by @thebigsmileXD, because he (me) read about players asking \"can we respawn players instantly\" in the PocketMine forums.
The answer is: YES!
With this plugin you are able to let players respawn instantly when they die and also cancel move for \* seconds.
## How to use
drop that plugin into your plugins folder
set the worlds where you want to use instantrespawn via */instantrespawn add <worldname>*
The players will die and respawn instantly.
Warning: with AlwaysSpawn they respawn at the hub/lobby, not the same world
## ToDo
- blindness workaround
- fix popup on death
- fix spam in console
- fix error on /instantrespawn ls
